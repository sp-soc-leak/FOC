# TOPIC 1A Basic Structure of Computers

# Basic Functions:
- Input: A user types the letter "A" on the keyboard, which results in sending a code representing the letter "A" to the computer.
- Processing: The computer's CPU determines what letter was tyed by looking up the keyboard code in a table.
- Output: The CPU sends instructions to the graphics cards to display the letter "A", which is then sent to the computer monitor.

# Processing Components:
- CPU: a computer's main Processing component
	- Executes instructions from the computer programs, such as word processors and from the computer's operating system.
- Current CPUs are composed of 2 or more processors called cores
	- A multi-core CPU is like a person with 2 brains
	- Multicore CPUs enable computers to carry out multiple instructions simultaneously
	- Results in better overall performance

# Storage Components:
- The more storage a computer has, the better the performance (in general)
- Most storage components are both input and output devices
- Most people think of storage as disk drives, CD/DVD drives, and USB flash drives.
- two main types of storage components: Short-term (volatile) and long term storage (non-volatile)

# Computer Bus Fundamentals
- Data Bus: Used to carry data signals from memory to CPU or vice versa or I/O (input/output) device and vice versa.
- Address Bus: Used to carry address signals like memory address location or port/interface where an IO device is attached.
- Control Bus: Used to carry control signals from CPU to memory or port/interface, for example; read and write

# NIC Basics and Wireless NIC
- Computers that is connected to a network requires a Network Interface Card (NIC) to create and mediate network connection.
	- contains MAC (Media Access Control) address. MAC addresses are unique ids that are assigned to NICs.
- Wireless NICs must be chosen according to the type of wireless AP which is referred to as WiFi
	- Some of the Wi-fi standards are wireless-n, 802.11ac or 802.11 a/b/g/n
	- Wiress NICs connect to network using the Service Set Identifier (SSID)
	- You may also need to enter a security key or a username and password depending on the network's security configuration
